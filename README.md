# MNIST Digit Recognition with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains code for building a simple digit recognition model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with TensorFlow and Keras. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/Maimoonakhan178/Hand_Digit_Classification_Using_MLP.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mnist-digit-recognition
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb
```

4. Follow along with the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Overview

- **`mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training, evaluating, and visualizing the digit recognition model.
- **`README.md`**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
